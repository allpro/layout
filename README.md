UI Layout – The Ultimate Page Layout Manager
============================================

OVERVIEW
--------

This widget was inspired by the extJS border-layout, and recreates that functionality in a jQuery plug-in. 
The Layout plug-in can create _any_ UI look you want - from simple headers or sidebars, 
to a complex application with toolbars, menus, help-panels, status bars, sub-forms, etc.

Combined it with other jQuery UI widgets to create a sophisticated application. 
There are no limitations or issues - this widget is ready for production use. 
If you create a good looking application using UI Layout, please let us know.

HISTORY & FUTURE
----------------

UI Layout was created over 5 years ago, and the borderLayout widget it replaced was around before that.
Sourcecode was only recently transferred to GitHub. It was also _re-registered_ on the jQuery plugins site.
You can find this plug-in on the jQuery site at: http://plugins.jquery.com/layout 

Documentation and other information will be updated for the latest version and migrated to GitHub over the summer. 
In the meantime you can find information and demos here:

- Website: http://layout.jquery-dev.com
- Support: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jquery-ui-layout

More information will be added here soon. This is just to get the process started...
